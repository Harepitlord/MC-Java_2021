// A java program that implement the following:
// Imagine a tollbooth at highways. The buses passing by the booth is expected to pay a toll. The tollbooth keeps the track of the number of buses that is gone by and the total amount of cash collected.
// # Create a class tollbooth with the data members as :-
// -total number of buses passed.
// -total toll collected.
// Write necessary member functions:
// 1. A constructors that initializes both data members to zero.
// 2. Paying bus(): when any bus passes through the tollbooth, that much toll gets added into total toll collected
// and total number of buses passed is incremented by one.
// 3. Nonpaying bus(): increments the bus total but adds nothing to cash total.
// 4. Display(): displays total no. of buses passed,no. of paid buses, no. of unpaid buses and the total amount collected.
